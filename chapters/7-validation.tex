\section{The Ideal Requirement}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Are we ready with this requirement? Elicit more? Specify more? Validate more?
  \item But the world is not perfect and resources are not unlimmited...
\end{itemize}


How do we check that the requirements are the right requirements?

How do we check that they are represented in a good way?
